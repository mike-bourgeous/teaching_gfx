# teaching_gfx
Helping a friend learn about bitmapped graphics, C, and Git.  These programs
demonstrate the connection between simple arrays and bitmapped graphics, in
order to demonstrate the connections between layers of abstractions in computer
systems.

The code structure is minimal; it's not an example of how to design the build
process or architecture of a large C program.

## Compiling

Type `make`.

## Viewing images

Redirect the output of a command to a file, open with The Gimp as indexed raw
image data.
